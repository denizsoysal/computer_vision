# Basic image processing on videos (filtering, detecting, ... even making disappear ^^)

* You will need a .mp4 video : this can be a video you make yourself, or one you found on the internet
* Do not forget to install python and openCV
* Then, you just have to adapt the main() function to make the processing at the time step you wish
* To run the code : python assignment1.py -i "input video directory" -o "input video directory"
